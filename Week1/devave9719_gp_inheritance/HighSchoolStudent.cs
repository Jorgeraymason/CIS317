* Assignment: SDC320 Week 1 GP – Inheritance
*
* This class represents a HighSchoolStudent object, which is derived
* from the Student class by adding the student's grade, class name,
* and an indicator of whether or not the student is in a college prep
* program. A constructor is provided to set all class and base class
* properties. The ToString is overridden and calls the
* GetStudentInformation method from the base class to provide the
* formatted data. The GetStudentInformation method is not overridden,
* so only the super class data will be returned by calls to that method.
