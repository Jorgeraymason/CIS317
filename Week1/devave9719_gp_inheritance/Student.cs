* This class represents a Student object, which is "ultimate" base
* class in this exercise. All other classes are derived from this
* class at some level. This class includes Name and SchoolName
* properties. The constructor takes parameters to set all properties.
* ToString is overridden and calls the GetStudentInformation method to
* provide the formatted data.
