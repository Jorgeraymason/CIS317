*
* This class represents an UndergraduateStudent object, which is
* derived from the CollegeStudent class by adding the student's
* year. A constructor is provided to set all class and base class
* properties. The ToString method is overridden and calls the
* GetStudentInformation method to provide the formatted properties.
* The GetStudentInformation method is also overridden and does not
* call the base class's method; rather it accesses the base class
* properties directly to provide a different format.
