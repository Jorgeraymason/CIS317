* This class represents a PrimarySchoolStudent object, which is derived
* from the Student class by adding the student's grade. A constructor is
* provided to set all class and base class properties. The ToString is
* overridden and calls the GetStudentInformation method to provide the
* formatted data. The GetStudentInformation method is also overridden and
* calls the base class GetStudentInformation method to get that class data.
