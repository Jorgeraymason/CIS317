* This class represents a GraduateStudent object, which is derived
* from the CollegeStudent class by adding an indicator for whether
* or not a thesis is required for the student. A constructor is provided
* to set all class and base class properties. ToString is overridden
* and calls the base class GetStudentInformation method to get that
* class's formatted properties. The GetStudentInformation method is
* also overridden in the same manner.
